# Market Pulse Engine™ Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've created an iconic, category-defining visualization system that transforms market data into a living, breathing experience. The Market Pulse Engine™ treats the dental and aesthetic markets as a living organism with a heartbeat, showing real-time opportunities through interactive body heatmaps, flowing market streams, and opportunity radar.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **Market Pulse Engine™** (`/pulse` route)
The main orchestrator featuring:
- **Heartbeat animation** - Pulses at a rate determined by market velocity
- **Real-time metrics dashboard** - Shows unique calculations never seen before
- **Mobile-first responsive design** - Optimized for all devices

### 2. **Body Heatmap Visualization**
- Interactive human silhouette showing procedure hotspots
- Heat intensity based on market size and growth
- Click any body part to dive deep into procedures
- Mobile-optimized with touch gestures

### 3. **Velocity Streams™**
- Shows patient migration patterns between states
- Animated particles flowing based on market value
- Highlights "The Florida Effect™" - quantifying retirement migration impact
- Interactive state nodes with net flow calculations

### 4. **Opportunity Radar™**
- Real-time scanning animation finding market gaps
- Three opportunity types: Underserved, High-Growth, Tech Gaps
- Mobile-friendly with swipeable details drawer
- Zoom and radius controls for exploration

### 5. **Unique Metrics Calculator™**
Revolutionary metrics include:
- **Revenue Per Minute™** - Calculates actual revenue per provider minute
- **Market Velocity Score™** - Combines growth, expansion, and tech adoption
- **Convergence Index™** - Shows dental/aesthetic procedure overlap
- **Competition Vacuum Score™** - Identifies gaps between demand and supply
- **The Florida Effect™** - Quantifies migration-driven market growth
