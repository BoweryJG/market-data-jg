# Sales Dashboard Transformation - Executive Summary

## 🚀 What We've Built: The "Can't Live Without It" Dashboard

### The Vision
We've completely reimagined the sales dashboard from the ground up, transforming it from a passive data display into an **active intelligence system** that tells reps exactly what to do, when to do it, and why it matters.

### Key Innovation: From Dashboards to Daily Actions
Traditional dashboards show what happened. Our Sales Intelligence Hub shows **what to do next**.
